# Constructing an ethical framework to evaluate HCI lab studies involving wearable technology

Read the project paper [here](Constructing%20an%20Ethical%20Framework.pdf).

One category of HCI research often disregarded by institutional review boards (IRBs) is that of lab studies that evaluate effectiveness of new interaction techniques/systems involving sensing and wearables. In this paper, I study the risks such research poses to the participants and propose a policy to mitigate those risks.

_This project was done as part of Brown University's HCI Seminar (CSCI 2300) course, under the advice of Prof Jeff Huang._
