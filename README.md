# Constructing an ethical framework to evaluate HCI lab studies involving wearable technology

Read the project paper [here](Constructing%20an%20Ethical%20Framework.pdf).

One category of HCI research often disregarded by IRBs is that of lab studies that evaluate effectiveness of new interaction techniques/systems involving sensing and wearables. In this paper, I study the risks such research poses to the participants and propose a policy to mitigate those risks.

A subset of social media platforms that I find particularly interesting is anonymous online community platforms (AOCPs), such as Reddit and Blind. Self-disclosive behavior (Archer, 1980) on AOCPs is often illustrated by what is known as the online disinhibition effect. Suler (2004) posits a number of factors that contribute to the creation of the online disinhibition effect. I was intrigued to understand how each factor contributes to the benign disinhibition effect on AOCPs. For my experiment, I focused on asynchronicity and how reducing asynchronicity influences the extent of “positive” self-disclosive behavior. To do this, I have designed a social mechanism that reduces the degree of asynchronicity in online (threaded) conversations. I then explore my hypothesis: "A mechanism that reduces conversational asynchronicity tends to degrade the quality of social support received by participants on an AOCP that implements such a mechanism."
